# Generate mesh

This page describes how to dynamically generate mesh object at runtime using a trait script.

Setup a simple scene with single plane in the center. Assign default material and create a static rigid body for the plane.

Now we can start writing a trait that will dynamically generate a mesh and spawn it in the scene. For this example Haxe is used.

Select Camera and attach a new trait using **Object tab - Armory Traits - +**. Hit **New Script** and name it **BoxGenerator**.

Pressing **Edit Script** will open our new trait script in **Kode Studio**. Example code below will generate a simple box, attach a rigid body trait and spawn it on the plane after pressing input.
