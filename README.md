Please consider reading through this manual before starting with Armory. The main limitations are:

- Limited documentation, bugs!
- Animation/UI/Renderer/.. systems need more work
- Potentially breaking backward compatibility

We are always looking for more feedback. Please do let us know about the issues you are facing at [GitHub](https://github.com/armory3d/armory/issues).
