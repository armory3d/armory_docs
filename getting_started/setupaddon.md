# Setup (add-on only)

If you do not require the built-in player, Armory can be used as add-on only in standard Blender installation. The player will then launch in separate window.

- [Download](http://armory3d.org/download.html) and unpack appropriate SDK for your platform.
- In Blender, Select **File** - **User Preferences...** and navigate to **Add-ons** tab.
- Click **Install from File...**
- Select **armory.py** located in *Armory/armsdk*
- **Enable** add-on and **set SDK location** to *Armory/armsdk*
- Hit **Save User Settings** at the bottom. That's it!
