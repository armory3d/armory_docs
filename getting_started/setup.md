# Setup

Armory bundle comes with everything you need. **Blender 2.79** is used with **Armory player** built in. **Blender 2.8** builds are also available, currently in experimental state. If you do not require the built-in player, Armory can be used as [add-on only](setupaddon.md). Armory sources are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/armory3d/).

- Unpack **Armory_version.zip** to your preferred location. On Windows, prefer a short path like 'C:\Dev' or unpack with [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org) to prevent long path errors.
- Run Blender located in unpacked SDK. On Windows, you may need to enable it for the first time by clicking **More info** - **Run anyway**.

- To verify everything is working correctly, save your .blend file and hit **Play in Viewport** button, located in the 3D view header.
