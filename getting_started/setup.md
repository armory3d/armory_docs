# Setup

Armory bundle comes with everything you need.

- [Download SDK](http://armory3d.org/download.html).
- Unpack `Armory_version.zip` to your preferred location. *(On Windows, prefer a short path like `C:\Dev` or unpack with [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org) to prevent long path errors and speed-up the extraction.)*
- Run Blender located in the unpacked SDK. *(On Windows, you may need to enable it for the first time by clicking **More info** - **Run anyway**. On Linux, open terminal in the extracted folder and type `./blender`. On macOS, see `instructions.txt` file.)*

- To verify everything is working correctly, save your .blend file, switch to `Cycles Render` or `Eevee` engine (using a drop down located in the info header) and hit `Play` (F5) button, located in the `Properties - Render - Armory Player` panel.

- Continue to the [Playground tutorial](/getting_started/playground.md) to learn more.

## Troubleshooting

- For old graphics cards, select `Low` preset in `Blender - Properties - Render - Armory Render Path`.
- When naming things, prefer unaccented alphabetical letters `A-Z`.
- If you wish to isolate config for the bundled Blender, create empty `config` folder in `Armory/2.80`.
- If you have problem with loading of addon, then go to debug console to catch the error.
- If you have any trouble setting things up, [let us know](http://armory3d.org/community.html)!

### Windows

- To see error messages, start Blender from console or press `Blender - Window - Toggle System Console`.
- `Type not found : Main` error - save your .blend in a safe path like `C:\Users\user_name\Documents\test`, otherwise Windows may prevent writing the files.
- If you get missing .dll errors, try installing [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746572).

### Linux

- To see error messages, start Blender from terminal using './blender'.

### macOS

- Due to security elements of macOS, you may get a `file corrupted` error. Try opening blender from terminal by typing `/path/to/Armory/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender` (right click on blender.app to open it contents).
- To see error messages, start Blender from terminal using `/path/to/Armory/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender`.


## Using Armory as add-on

If you do not require the built-in player, Armory can be used as add-on only in standard Blender installation. The player will then launch in a separate window.

- [Download](http://armory3d.org/download.html) and unpack appropriate SDK for your platform.
- In Blender, Select **File** - **User Preferences...** and navigate to **Add-ons** tab.
- Click **Install from File...**
- Select `armory.py` located in `my_unpacked_sdk/Armory/armsdk/armory/blender/addon` (on MacOS the location is `my_unpacked_sdk/Armory/Blender.app/armsdk/armory/blender/addon`).
- **Enable** Armory add-on.
- Set **SDK Path** property to `my_unpacked_sdk/Armory/armsdk`.
- Hit **Save User Settings** at the bottom and restart Blender. That's it!
