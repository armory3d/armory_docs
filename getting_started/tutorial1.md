# Tutorial 1 - Basics

This page describes how to build a simple scene with rotating monkey and interactive camera.

Boot up Blender located in Armory SDK and save the blend file.

Delete the cube and add monkey.

Create a new material for the monkey. Switch to node editor, delete the default **Diffuse BSDF** node and select **Add** - **Group** - **Armory PBR**. This node is recommended for the PBR workflow.

Switch to world nodes and add **Sky Texture** node. Set **Background** strength to 3.0.

Select Lamp and set **Emission** strength to 1000.

Back in 3D view, place a plane under the monkey.

To make monkey rotate, we will add a new trait. Select monkey and locate **Armory Traits** in object properties. Hit **+** to add empty trait. Set **Haxe Script** as type. Hit **New Script** and confirm.

Next, hit **Edit Script** and Kode Studio opens. We want to rotate the monkey a bit every frame. Uncomment **notifyOnUpdate** function and make it look like this:

```haxe
notifyOnUpdate(function() {
    object.transform.rotate(armory.math.Vec4.zAxis(), 0.01);
});
```

If you want to use logic nodes instead, switch to node editor. Select logic nodes category, click **New** and compose the node tree below. In **Armory Traits**, select **Logic Nodes** as type and set **Tree** entry.

Switch back to 3D view, navigate to modifier properties and add **Subdivision Surface** modifier. Set Render subdivisions to 1.

In Render properties, locate **Armory Player** panel. Set **Camera** to **Viewport**. This will allow to control the camera with mouse and keyboard, similar to enabling walk navigation in viewport.

Ready to go! Hit **Play in Viewport** (shortcut P) to run.

**Stop** the player (shortcut ESC) and select **Browser** runtime in **Armory Player** panel. Hit **Play** (shortcut F5) and scene opens in the [browser](http://armory3d.org/demo/scene1)!
