## Native target

For the C++ compilation to succeed you might need to install some additional packages - read more at [Kha/Wiki](https://github.com/Kode/Kha/wiki/Linux).

Create a new preset in *Properties - Render - Armory Exporter* and select Linux target. Hit *Publish* to export build files.

Afterwards, you can compile the project using the generated makefile or using the [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org) project located at *blend_file_location/build_projectname/linux-build*
