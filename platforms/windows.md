Create a new preset in *Properties - Render - Armory Exporter* and select Windows target. Hit *Publish* to export Visual Studio project files.

To proceed, install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). Make sure to install components for compiling C++ code. Once installed, open the project located at *blend_file_location/build_projectname/windows-build/project_name.sln*.
