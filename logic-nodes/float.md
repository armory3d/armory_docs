# Float

### Category: Variable

Stores a Float value. A Float variable is a number with a limited number of decimals and it has a minimum/maximum, but you do not have to worry about those because they are so many/high/low, you will never reach them. If your number has more than 3 decimals, the value displayed will be rounded, but when you click on it you can still see the whole number, which will also be used in the game.
