### Category: Logic

Logic nodes way to do "if" statements. When activated, it compares if its two inputs are being Equal, Greater Equal, Less Equal, or Not Equal, regardless of variable type, and passes through its red input if the set state is the case.

"And" and "Or" are being used for booleans only, and pass through the input when both bools are true \(and\) or at least one \(or\).
